## Getting started with GTSAM

To build GTSAM from source, clone or download the latest release from the [GTSAM Github repo](https://github.com/borglab/gtsam). Then follow the build & install instructions below.

In python, you can use `pip install gtsam`, and look at the examples on github to get started.

## Getting started with OpenSAM

We intend to release an early pilot version of OpenSAM running on NXP's S32v platform, available to members only, in June 2020. A public release is scheduled for August.

The video below, generously provided by Holomatic, shows a development version of OpenSAM in action on several highway scenarios:
