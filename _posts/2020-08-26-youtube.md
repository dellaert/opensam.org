We are starting a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCurpOOuU0bbSEug90Y1AruQ) that we will gradually fill with short explainers. For now there are only two videos by [Frank Dellaert](https://dellaert.github.io/), one from RSS and one from ECCV. However, [Cyrill Stachniss](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/people/cyrill-stachniss/) is working on a 5-minute intro to factor graphs, and Frank is preparing something about Bayes trees. Stay tuned, and subscribe to the channel if interested!
