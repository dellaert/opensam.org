Today we launched OpenSAM's new web presence, [opensam.org](http://opensam.org). The site is hosted by Github Pages, and is generated via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a simple static website generator.

At the moment, the page still looks rather spartan, but we'll add a little more design features as time goes on.
