## Mission

The OpenSAM Foundation (OSF) is a non-profit organization that seeks to advance the use of factor graphs for sensor fusion in robotics and computer vision applications. 

It supports the continued development of two open-source sensor fusion libraries based on factor graphs: GTSAM and OpenSAM.

## GTSAM & OpenSAM 

The goals for these two projects are:

* *GTSAM*: Advance the state-of-the-art research on factor graphs for large-scale optimization and sensor fusion for robotics and computer vision problems. GTSAM is popular among both academia and industry researchers, with algorithms that are more adaptive and easier to expand.

* *OpenSAM*: Provide an industry-standard, factor graph sensor fusion reference implementation optimized for embedded systems. OpenSAM is provides a reference for product development in industry and pays careful attention to embedded optimization, security, and certification.

GTSAM and OpenSAM are compatible with each other for easy migration.
Successful exploration in GTSAM will lead to new features in OpenSAM.

## Key Concepts

SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) has been recognized as one of the most crucial technologies in many robotics and computer vision applications.

GTSAM & OpenSAM are open libraries for solving optimization problems represented by factor graphs such as SAM (smoothing and mapping), the key problem in most state-of-the-art SLAM pipelines.

OpenSAM contains reference implementations for some widely used system configurations and we offer commercial licenses for OSF members.
